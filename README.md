Neon Demon: The Demon that controls Shop Status
===============================================

In order to control the shop status of our hackerspace (h3laboratories - h3laboratories.com) we wrote a demon on a Rasberry PI 2 which also has a web interface were one can log in and set the shop status (open/closed) and a message. Immediatly after loggin in the message and status will show up on a sequence of images/videos and our website and twitter will be correspondingly updated. The demon is based on the rpi-rgb-led-matrix library (https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/). If you want to learn more about this project look at https://h3laboratories.com/introducing-neon/.
